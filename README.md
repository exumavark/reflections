# Readme!

This repository contains notes and reflections on a nanodegree course that I am currently busy with at **Udacity**.

The name of the course is *"How to Use Git and GitHub"*.

More information on the course can be found [here](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775).
